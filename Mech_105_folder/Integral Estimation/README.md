## Simpson's Rule
###### The function estimates the integral of a data set using Simpson's 1/3
###### rule. If there is an odd number of intervals, the last interval integral is
###### estimated with the trapizoid rule
##### Inputs
------
###### x = equally spaced x-values of integral 
###### y = outputs of data set at x-values
##### Output
------
###### I = estimate of the integral
##### Limitations
------
###### Must have equally spaced x-value data points. The data set must have an 
###### equal number of x and y values
