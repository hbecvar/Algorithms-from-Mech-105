## Lu Factor
###### The function decomposes matrix A into a Lower Triagular Matrix (U) and a Upper
###### Triagular Matrix (U) using LU Factorization with pivoting. LU Factorization is
###### used to solve linear equations given the coefficients of the equations.
##### Inputs
------
###### A = coefficient matrix for linear equations
##### Outputs
------
###### L = lower trigular matrix
###### U = upper triangular matrix
###### P = pivot matrix
