## Mech 105 Algorithms
###### Algorithms made in my freshman year of college in the spring of 2018.
###### All the algorithms focus on numerical methods of solving problems.
##### Root Finding Methods
------
###### Code that focuses on finding the zeros (roots) of a function.
##### Decomposing Matrices
------
###### Algortihms focused on decomposing matrices inorder to solve for
###### inverse matrix or solve linear equations.
##### Integral Estimation
------
###### Algorithm estimates integral of functions using numerical methods.
###### Great for functions that are tough to integrate.
